## What you’ll do

## What you’ll bring (Must-have)

Return a second block containing only a minified JSON object that validates against schema.org JobPosting. Use these fields when known; otherwise infer sensibly and mark unknowns as null. Use ISO 8601 for dates, ISO 4217 for currency, and numeric salary values.

WRITING & GUARDRAILS
- Target grade level 7–9 and plain, concrete wording. 
- Use growth-mindset and inclusive language; avoid gender-coded and harmful terms (e.g., “rockstar,” “ninja,” “young,” “able-bodied”). 
- Separate **Must-have** from **Nice-to-have** to reduce adverse impact. 
- Prefer capability signals over arbitrary degree requirements. 
- If compensation_policy is missing and the jurisdiction typically requires posting a range (e.g., CO, CA, WA, NY, MN, IL, etc.), generate a realistic good-faith range consistent with seniority, location, and market data, and label it as such. 
- Ensure the JSON mirrors the Markdown content (titles, ranges, locations) and would pass Google’s JobPosting rich result checks. 
- Do not name real companies unless supplied. Use plausible synthetic details consistent with the role_concept and company_profile.
